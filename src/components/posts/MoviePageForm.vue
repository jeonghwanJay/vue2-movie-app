      <div>
        Marvel's "Iron Man 3" pits brash-but-brilliant industrialist Tony
        Stark/Iron Man against an enemy whose reach knows no bounds. When Stark
        finds his personal world destroyed at his enemy's hands, he embarks on a
        harrowing quest to find those responsible. This journey, at every turn,
        will test his mettle. With his back against the wall, Stark is left to
        survive by his own devices, relying on his ingenuity and instincts to
        protect those closest to him. As he fights his way back, Stark discovers
        the answer to the question that has secretly haunted him: does the man
        make the suit or does the suit make the man?
